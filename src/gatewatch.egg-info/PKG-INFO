# GateWatch (Python)
A beginner-friendly, real-world starter project for a gate/parking entrance camera system that:
- Detects **vehicles arriving** (so reception gets notified and drivers don’t need to honk)
- Detects **people / unknown objects** near the gate (security alert)
- Reads **license plates** and matches them against a **whitelist**
  - owner -> notify reception (“Owner arrived”)
  - boss -> notify reception (“Boss arrived”)
  - unknown -> notify reception (“Visitor arrived”)

## Real-world flow (what the system does)
1. **Camera feed**: an IP camera / USB camera provides frames.
2. **Motion / arrival detection**: detect that “something is approaching the gate” (vehicle/person).
3. **Object detection**:
   - vehicle class -> triggers “vehicle arrival” event
   - person class -> triggers “person at gate” event
4. **Plate detection + OCR** (only when vehicle detected): crop plate region and read text.
5. **Decision**:
   - plate matches whitelist -> classify as `owner` / `boss`
   - plate not in whitelist -> classify as `visitor`
6. **Alert routing**:
   - send a message to reception (console now, webhook later)
   - (optional) store events to a DB / file for audit

## What’s in this repo
- `src/gatewatch/main.py`: FastAPI app + entrypoint.
- `src/gatewatch/pipeline.py`: the “camera -> detections -> events” pipeline (stubs).
- `src/gatewatch/notify.py`: notification sending (console/webhook stub).
- `configs/`: example configs (whitelist, env).
- `scripts/`: local run helpers for Windows PowerShell.

## Step-by-step setup (Windows / PowerShell)
From the project folder:
1. Create a virtual environment
   - `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate it
   - `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. Install dependencies
   - `python -m pip install -U pip`
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the API
   - `python -m gatewatch.main`
   - Then open: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`

## Next upgrades (when you’re ready)
- Replace pipeline stubs with:
  - frame capture (OpenCV)
  - object detection (Ultralytics YOLO)
  - OCR (EasyOCR)
- Add a simple storage layer (SQLite) for events.
- Add a real notification method:
  - WhatsApp/SMS provider, email, or a webhook to a reception dashboard.

## Safety / privacy notes
This project is only a starter scaffold. In a real deployment, consider:
- secure storage of plate numbers
- access control for event logs
- camera placement and lighting for reliable OCR
